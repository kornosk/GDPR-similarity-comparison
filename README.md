# GDPR Similarity Comparison
We extract information from GDPR-like documents from different countries written in natuaral language and construct well-strucured data.

The structured data are 4 columns including chapter, section, article and recital. This could benefit any future work that would like to explore GDPR-like using computational methods. 🚀

This project is inspired by [COSC-824 Data Protection by Design](https://courses.benujcich.georgetown.domains/cosc824/sp2021/), Department of Computer Science at Georgetown University.

## Data
We convert from PDF to Docx to CSV with well-structured style. Now, our data include GDPR-like documents from:
* European 🇪🇺
* Brazil 🇧🇷
* Indian 🇮🇳
* What next? 😉

Simply load the data into a dataframe in `Python` as following code.

```python
import pandas as pd

file_path = "data/LGPD-ES-Brazil-converted.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(file_path) # columns: ["chapter", "section", "article", "recital"]
```
